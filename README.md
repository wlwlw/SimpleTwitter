## SimpleTwitter

<img src="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~lwang107/userfiles/images/document/design_scale.png" width="70%">

A simple but scalable twitter-like information dessemination service (call it SimpleTwitter for short) that provides a minimum set of functionality including posting tweet, deleting tweet, subscribing/unsubscribing other users and viewing subscribed users' tweets in timeline fashion. A running instance is deployed as a [Demo](http://simpletwitter.liang-w.xyz/).

The backend of this project is an implementation to [https://github.com/CMU-440-F16/p2](https://github.com/CMU-440-F16/p2) (with some modifications).

### Use cases

**Creating User:**
User need first sign up before posting any tweet or subscribing other users. For simplicity, we donâ€™t allow user to delete account.

**Subscribing/Unsubscribing:** Users can subscribe other users. Such subscription relations should be stored.

**Posting Tweets:** Users can post tweet. Which can contains string and image. 

**Deleting Tweets:** Given a user id and a key uniquely identifying a tweet. If the tweet is posted by that user, then it can be deleted.

**Timeline:** Given a user id, returns a list of most recent tweets of that user. 

**Home Timeline:** Given a user id, returns a list of most recent tweets of all users
subscribed by that user (including the user itself).

```

To deploy system on localhost, type

```
./deoply.sh
```

To run the tests, type

```
$GOPATH/tests/runall.sh
```

To start up each server manually, you can first

```
go install runners/rstorage
go install runners/rstwserver
go install runners/rwebserver
```

then

```
$GOPATH/bin/rstorage -port=${STORAGE_PORT}
$GOPATH/bin/rstwserver -port=${STW_PORT} -storageMaster="localhost:${STORAGE_PORT}"
$GOPATH/bin/rwebserver -masterApp="localhost:${STW_PORT}"
```

Parameter specifications of each server can be found in `$GOPATH/src/runners`.

### Stress Test

Depoly system on a single laptop and run 10 clients with each of them perform 1000 random operations among **Creating User**,**Subscribing/Unsubscribing**,**Posting Tweets**,**Timeline**,**Home Timeline**. Measure time consumed to finish all operations:

| Total Operations |Web Server|App Server|Storage Server| Time Consumed(s) |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|:--:|:--:|
| 10000      | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1.962181201 |
| 10000      | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2.089283155 |
| 10000      | 1 | 3 | 3 | 2.918431771 |

(TO DO: Measuring on multiple machines)
